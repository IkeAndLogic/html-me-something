 <h3>Background</h3>
 <p>I was born and raised in Enugu state, Nigeria and there, I had my primary and secondary education. <br>
 I got the opportunity to move the United States right after high school through the diversity visa program.<br>
 I left my family and moved to my now-adopted-hone town in Bloomington-Normal Illinois to start my new life. <br>
 This life changing experience has granted me many more opportunities including completing my first college<br> 
 degree. It was in college that I had my first exposure to coding. I took a beginners class java class and<br>
 I liked it. Although programing had nothing to do with my major at the time, I always thought I could program<br> 
 and build things in my spare time.  I’ve since then tired many other coding languages and I’ve come to love <br>
 web/design and development as a whole. I recently enrolled at  Johnson County Community College web development <br>
 degree program to learn more about web development.
